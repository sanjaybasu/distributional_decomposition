# Distributional decomposition

While the theoretical importance of a distributional perspective has long between established in epidemiology, a critical gap in the field has been finding methodological approaches to empirically engage with the distributional perspective. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic tests whether overall differences between two distributions may be considered significant, but cannot identify the degree to which a given risk factor may explain these differences. Quantile regression provides estimates of how risk factors may alter an outcome within each quantile of the population distribution of a disease risk factor, but requires parametric assumptions difficult to uphold for many empirical distributions. 
Here we introduce a nonparametric decomposition technique, which identifies how changes in modifiable risk factors for the outcome variable could reduce disparities at different points along the distribution of an outcome variable.
